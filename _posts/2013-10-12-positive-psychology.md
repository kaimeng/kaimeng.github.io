Good evening, everyone. Today I want to talk about something that I just learned from Harvard's most popular lesson, Positive Psychology. Perhaps some of you already seen it. It was taught by Dr. Tale Ben Shahar. He enjoyed high reputation among his Harvard students, and he was known as the "most popular lecturer" and "life coach".

It is a course teach you how to become happier. Actually I didn't feel happy very often before. When I was in college, when I was in work for recent years. I just began to watch this course two weeks ago, and I decided to take one lesson every week , and give a speech about what I learned from the lessons. So there would be a series of speeches I'm going to address about this topic afterwards.

In china, someone who studies very hard but does not apply to work or life and is a bit numb is called "书呆子". It is very important to apply those theories, ideas into your life. So I'm also hope that those ideas I learned from the course can be applied to my actual life, make me really happier, not just know some materials that I can talk about.

When we learn something, we always get a lot of information. The first thing about this course is not just about information, it is also about transformation. What is information, think our mind, it is a container, when we learn something, we put something into the container. When the container is full, we say that we have learned enough. Transformation is about change the form of the container, change the form of our mind. Think about this example. You took an exam, your aim is to get into the top 10, you end up with number 30. What do you think? -- Terrible. I just failed, you feel it is a disaster. But on the other hand, the exact same event, you came 30 when you expected top 10. You can think as "OK, what have I learned? I need to study harder." You see, one information, very different feelings. One is a disaster, the other is an opportunity. One leads to loss of energy, the other to increasing energy.

In other words, it's not just about the information that goes in. It's also the shape, the perception, the focus. And that's where transformation comes in. And that's why it's so important for welling. So in practice, what we need to do is to find the potential that have inside, the eyes to see beauty, the mind to see opportunity.

So this is Michelangelo, "米开朗基罗", One day he was asked by a journalist, "how did you create this masterpiece, David?",Michelangelo responded, "it was easy. I went to the quarry. I saw this huge piece of marble. And in it I saw David. All I needed to do was to chip away the excess stone. And when I got rid of this excess stone, there was David." What we need to do is just chip away those excess stone, those limitations around us, and finally, you'll see a wonderful yourself.

When we are kid, we don't have so many limitations, we always asked many questions, we don't have the fear of failure. A study done in Harvard for 20 years from 1970s to 1990s. It studied a large group of highly successful MBAs. It found a small group that was extraordinarily successful, more successful than the rest of the group. Why this small group of people was so successful than the majority. It found two things: The first thing was the extraordinarily successful groups really believe in themselves. They thought "I'm going to make it. I'm going to succeed." The second thing was,they were always asking questions. They didn't say "Now I have my MBA. That's it. I know enough. " They were life-long learners. These two distinguishing characteristics made the differences between the extraordinarily successful and ordinary successful.

That's the few things I learned from the first lesson of this course. Learn the way of transformation, the power of believing yourself, the magic of being open. Chip off those excess stone of your mind, and find a way to your happiness.
