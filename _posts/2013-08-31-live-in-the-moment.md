Good evening, my dear fellow toastmasters and welcomed guests. My topic for tonight's speech is Live in the Moment. First I'd like to ask you a question: If you are going to die tomorrow, what would you do for the rest of your life.

(Ask two people)

We're not going to die tomorrow, we still have some time, but we shall die, won't we?

I remember when I was in middle school, I was very fond of music, I asked mum whether I could learn to play some instruments, mum told me I will learn when I'm in college. When I was in college, I liked a girl, but I told myself I should wait until I'm good enough for her. After graduation I went to work, for many times I was tired of living such a life, but I thought I should earn enough money before I could enjoy my life. I was always deaming about being happy someplace else, sometime else.

Now I'm learning how to live in the moment, how to live like there's no tomorrow. I realized if I wait for a better me to come, I'll wait forever. I should wait for nothing before I can enjoy my life. I must realize there's beauty in every moment, in everyday activities. And here are some tips for myself.

1. Dance like nobody's watching.

	I read this sentence first from a poem: dance like nobody's watching, love like you've never been hurt. I believe those 4 words sums the entire sprit of living in the moment.

2. Take notice of the world.

	When you walk down the street, look at the trees beside the road, the birds fly and sing in the trees. And really look at a flower. What does it smell like? How many petals does it have? Are there any bugs going about on this plant?

3. Focus on whatever you are doing.

     Even if you are just walking, or having a cup of coffee in your break time. How does it feel? How does the coffee taste exactly? Pay attention to your senses, make it seemed like the rest of the world just disappeared. Living in the moment is about to creat that state of mind at any time.

4. Smile when you wake up.

     When you wake up, make a comfortable smile on you face. Don't wake up with a groan of your alarm clock. I tried many times for this, it do make me feel better after getting up.

That's the four thips for myself to live in the moment. Some friends here don't like to come to this stage. Don't just watch, we need participation, you will have a wonderful life here. This is your life, now live!
