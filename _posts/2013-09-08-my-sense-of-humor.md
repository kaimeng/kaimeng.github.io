When I heard about the classification of this contest, humorous speech, I just got stucked. I'm not a humrous person who can tell funny jokes and stories, especially on the stage, in English. So when I started writing my speech script, I have no idea what kind of things I can write.

But I have to write the script, started two weeks ago, I finished it until last night. My sister said that my writing script like a man sitting on a closestool, for two hours, and still nothing. I have to say it's much worse than that. You kown Jacky Cheung's song, I wait until the flowers are withered. But for me,  I waited until the flowers bloomed again.

For a person who has no sense of humor, what should I do? I know that humor is very import. In work, it can make the relationship between you and your colleagues much more comfortable; In life, it can melt the the ice you made with your other half. It is also very important in dating with girls, those boys who are humorous or handsome are always very popular. For me, with my poor appearance, if I can't make girls laugh, how can I find a girl, I'll be single forever. So for the happiness of the rest of my life, I decided to become a humorous person.

In order to improve my sense of humor, I need to know what is humor. I searched on the internet, read the books, and found the definition. What is humor?, the definition says humor is the tendency of particular cognitive experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. Oh my god, my dear friends, can you understand that, can you get what humor is. I've no idea what the sentence is telling about. Humor is so deep and high, I even can't understand it, how can I get to know the way to use it, and make a speech in that way. I got a big headache afterwards.

I kept sitting in front of the computer writing my speech script, at the same time, I put a cold wet towel on my head to ease my headache. I need some way to make it through, I can't get stucked all the time. So I tried to watch some funny videos to find some clues for my speech. There are many funny videos on youku, you know, so I began to watch some of them. Those vedios are so funny, as soon as I started watching them, I forgot my speech at all. After I laughed for two hours in front of the screen, I found that I still know nothing about how to write my humorous speech script.

It doesn't work, wasted two hours. I need to find some new way. Maybe telling jokes is a good idea.  So I told a funny story to my sister, heard from the contest of Xiamen TMC last week. After telling the joke, I thought it was so funny, so I laughed and laughed. But after I laughed for so long time, my sister was still so calm, and then she asked me, why are you laughing so happily.

Don't you think it is funny? I said.
No, I didn't realize it. She said.
And I told her again. Balabala... and began to laugh again.
It is really funny, and she laughed, HeHe..

That is my poor sense of humor. Is it really so bad, my friends?  Never mind, If nobody get into laugh with my jokes, I'll laugh by myself.
