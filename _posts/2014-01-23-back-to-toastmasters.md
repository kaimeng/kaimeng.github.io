After a long time break (more than two months), I got back to toastmasters today. I shoud have gotten back earlier, after I came back to suzhou. But for these two months, I did nothing.

Joined two toastmaster meetings today. First is the Seagate Toastmasters meeting. It's a company club, very far away in industrial park. But I got an interview in industrial park, so it was not very far away to go there.

I love the the meeting, it was exciting there, and the members there were very friendly. Because it uses their working time to do the meeting, the time is a bit tight. At the end of the meeting, I was invited to say something. At first I was thinking to say something of the speeches. One speech delivered by a girl named Oliver was very facinating. But when I stood up, I don't know why I spoke so fast that I forgot to metion that. I even raised a suggestion that their evaluation shoud be more specific. I think I made a mistake. AS a special guest(mentioned by the toatmaster), I maybe only need to say something good and I enjoyed the time is ok. Even though that their meeting had that point to improve, I did not need to pointed it out.

The second meeting is at Suzhou Toastmasters Club, in the evening. Also a very great meeting. They are going to have their 5 year anniversary party after the Chinese New Year. Many members and guests joined the meeting tonight. After the meeting on the way home, chatted with some girls on the metro. Two of them live very far away, but they come regularly.

In the moring I had an interview of Oracle company in suzhou. Oracle is a facinating company that many people want to work in. I really want that too. But the interview was not good. For the technical questions, many of them I gave bad answers. I know I have a lot things to learn.

A few things I want to tell myself:

1. Keep positive and keep learning;
2. Accept your mistakes, and learn from them;
2. Never, never give up!
